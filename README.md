# Girly Content Analysis on Netflix 🎀💅💖

## 📌Project Overview
This project explores the presence and characteristics of “girly” TV content on Netflix using exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
The aim is to understand how frequently this type of content appears, which genres and countries dominate it, and how it differs from overall Netflix TV shows in terms of seasons and ratings.

This is a personal and original data analysis project, designed to demonstrate analytical thinking, data manipulation, and visualization skills using Python.

- Girly content is predominantly produced in North America  
- On average, girly TV shows tend to have more seasons than the overall TV show average  
- Most girly content targets teen and adult audiences

Despite being limited in quantity, girly TV shows demonstrate relatively higher longevity in terms of season count.  
This suggests stronger audience engagement or niche loyalty and highlights the strategic value of niche-focused content on streaming platforms.
